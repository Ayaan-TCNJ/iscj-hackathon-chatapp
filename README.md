# iscj-hackathon-chatapp
Problem statement
This our ISCJ Hackathon submission
The current chat apps are centralized and subject to misuse by powerful people.  
These chat apps lack privacy because companies can access your data. 
Algorithms push questionable content to younger ages.  
Proprietary and censorship are the two main issues with these current chat apps. 

Proposal
We want to make an ISCJ social media app
 Messaging should be less chaotic and have a more decentralized architecture.  (This means that 
We need to move away from run of the mill apps like Instagram, Facebook, etc. 
This app helps the community by creating a more centralized form of communication.
